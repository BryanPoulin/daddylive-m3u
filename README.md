# DaddyLive TV
DaddyLive is a platform that offers live TV and sports streaming across selected categories. Users can stream and watch live TV directly through their browser without the need for an account or subscription.

For added flexibility, this repository provides an M3U playlist featuring DaddyLive's channels. With this, you can load the streams into any IPTV application that supports M3U-formatted playlists, however this repo will only provide the playlist format for Tivimate. Figure out how to format it for other applications yourself.

You can view the full list of channels provided by DaddyLive [here](https://daddylive.dad/24-7-channels.php). 

**Note:** Adult channels have been omitted (you goon).
